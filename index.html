       <h3> Aspiring Artist|Singer </h3>
       <p> Since then I never thought that Music will become a big part of my life. Music really inspires me to live, through songs I can express what i feel that I want to express. Without music, I'm not totally complete because <em> I firmly believe music lives in me and It will always be part of my me. </em></p>

       <h3> I like <strong>rainy days</strong> </h3>
       <p class="purple-color"> I can't deny that I also hate it when the rain falls when it's time for me to go home </p>
