       <h3> Aspiring Artist|Singer </h3>
       <p> Since then I never thought that Music will become a big part of my life. Music really inspires me to live, through songs I can express my voice and feelings that I cannot explain. Without music I'm not totally complete because <strong>I believe </strong><em>music  lives in me and It will always be part of my soul. </em></p>
